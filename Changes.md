# Version 1.1

* Added a hack to add a ``type="text/css`` to link elements referring to stylesheets. Not necessary per HTML, but some reading systems require it
* Added an ``("area","href")`` pair to the list of external references that should be checked and act upon.


Plus some minor bug and documentation improvements.

# Version 1.0

First "official" release
