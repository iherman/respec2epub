# To-Dos

* Utils.py contains the `change_DOM` method that implements a hack around a Readium bug. When the newer version of Readium is deployed, that hack should be removed.


# Possible improvements (mainly if there is demand, which is not sure)
* Bikeshed is shaky as for finding the dated uri. At the moment, it does not always work; leave it as is. At some point this may have to be looked at again, if the CSS people are really interested...
* Multi-file documents; essentially, taking over some of the features from [tr2epub](https://github.com/iherman/tr2epub)
* Is it possible to combine it with the bikeshed process?
