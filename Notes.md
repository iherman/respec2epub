How to do this: does a display none works with a @pages output? Probably not…

The bottomline seems to be: touching the old approach may not be worth the trouble, due to the
* handling of the margins that require changes anyway
* the problem with the ``html5lib`` bug
* the approach of making the TOC invisible anyway...

An alternative is to wait and see whether there will be a possibility to choose between the old version and the new. It may very well be that the new setting would work without further ado (just referring to a different ``base.css``) and with an additional trick of removing the TOC. The real question will be
* Is it possible to see if the document should be processed with the new or the old style sheet, or
* The new style sheet will be the only one that counts

To ask…
